# Convex Optimization
This repository contains my coursework and projects from the Convex Optimization class offered by the EE Department in Spring 2025.

  Convex sets,
  Convex functions,
  Convex problems,
  Duality,
  Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions,
  Subgradient methods,
  Statistical estimation,
  Geometric problems,
  Complexity analysis,
